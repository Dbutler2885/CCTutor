Loading the Chrome Extension:
-Open the Google Chrome browser (only works in chrome)
-Click on the three dots in the upper right corner to open the menu. Go to > Extensions> Manage Extensions 

-Enable Developer mode by toggling the switch in the top right corner of the Extensions page.
-Click on the Load unpacked button. Navigate to the location where you cloned the repository, or downloaded the zip. Open the CCTutor folder, and select the folder that contains the extension's code. Namely the base folder.
 The extension should now be added to your Chrome and is ready to use.

**To use this extension:**
Open your Codecademy Course.
Open a Chatgpt window. You may need to refresh to see the button.  Look for Ask GPTutor button.
Refresh your codecademy course window. (you have to get both pages synced up, this can take a couple page refreshes. I think it is best to refresh chatgpt, and then refresh codecademy.)
When the ‘Ask GPTutor’ button lights up, it has received all the data from the codecademy course and if you click the button, chatgpt will be prompted with all the data from that page of your course. It should respond with something like “I see where you’re at, do you have any questions?” then you can ask any questions about the content of the page. When you complete a question on the codecademy course site, the button will light up again, indicating the ability to update your GPTutor on the latest question. It should have all the information, including the contents of the terminal, the code editor, and the question content. 
It is even supposed to respond to hints. There is a bug associated with hints however. It always includes the previous hint even if the hint is no longer active. This can be annoying, but if you tell the bot to ignore the hint because it is an old one, it should do so fairly easily.  
As evidenced by this above bug, this extension is not 100% bug-free but it should be stable. I hope it helps people learn programming. Enjoy!
